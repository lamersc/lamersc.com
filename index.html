            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>
                An 18 year old programmer with a passion for computers stemming back from the age of 11. 
                I got deep into programming at 13, and have been perfecting my craft since; I've built websites, servers, chatbots, and have even reverse engineered a few apps.

            <h2>What interests me?</h2>
            <p>
                If we're speaking computer wise, it would have to be understanding the low level architectures.
                I've always found a beauty in how so many delicate pieces could function together;  having the ability to harness those pieces has always awed me.

            <p>
                <mark>
                    A language that especially builds onto that curiosity for me is <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>.
                </mark>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                If we're speaking in terms of day-to-day life, it would definitely have to be playing basketball,
                researching interesting academia, listening to my plentiful amount of music, and enjoying the occasional TV series.
